PHP Configuration Changes for XAMPP
=====================================

File: C:\xampp\php\php.ini

Find and update these lines:

1. post_max_size = 100M
   (Currently: 40M - needs to be increased)

2. upload_max_filesize = 100M  
   (Currently: 40M - needs to be increased)

3. max_file_uploads = 20
   (Keep this as is - allows multiple files)

4. memory_limit = 512M
   (Currently: 512M - this is fine)

5. max_execution_time = 300
   (Add this if not present - for large file uploads)

6. max_input_time = 300
   (Add this if not present - for large file uploads)

After making these changes:
1. Save the php.ini file
2. Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel
3. Test the upload functionality

Alternative: Create .htaccess file in project root with:
php_value post_max_size 100M
php_value upload_max_filesize 100M
php_value max_execution_time 300
php_value max_input_time 300
