# Housing Calculator — Input Handling Summary

## 🐛 Problems Addressed
The calculator inputs previously broke because:
- Using `input[type="number"]` but trying to set `.value` to formatted text like "Rs. 50,000" or "50,000"
- Browsers silently reject non-numeric values for number inputs
- This caused text to disappear and made the form feel broken

## ✅ Implemented Solution (as coded)

### 1) Runtime input formatting
**Before:**
```html
<input type="number" ...>
```

**After:**
```html
<input type="text" inputmode="decimal" ...>
```

Applied to all calculator inputs:
- Down Payment (Flat & Construction)
- Split Payment fields (Booking, Allocation, Confirmation, Start of Work)
- All Installment fields (Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, Yearly)
- Possession Fee
- Construction Costs (Slab, Plinth, Colour)

### 2) Safe numeric parsing
All calculations use a `toNumber()` helper which strips commas and invalid characters and returns 0 for invalid/negative values. This prevents NaN/Infinity.

### 3) Display vs data separation
Inputs show comma‑formatted numbers; the "My Budget" header and hidden fields contain clean rounded numbers for submit.

### 4) Split Down Payment behavior
When checked: show split fields and sum them live; the Down Payment field becomes read‑only and mirrors the sum. When unchecked, the Down Payment field is editable again.

### 5) Coverage
Down Payment, all Installments, Possession (optional), Construction extras (Slab, Plinth, Colour), and Split fields (Booking, Allocation, Confirmation, Start of Work).
