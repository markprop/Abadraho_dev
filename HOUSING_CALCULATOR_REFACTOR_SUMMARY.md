- **Construction Costs**: Only included in total when Construction tab is active
- **Possession Fee**: Always added once to total budget

### 2. Enhanced UI/UX & Feedback
- **Budget Breakdown Panel**: Real-time breakdown showing:
  - Down Payment: Rs. 500,000
  - Monthly Installments: Rs. 960,000
  - Possession: Rs. 100,000
  - Construction Costs: Rs. 200,000 (Construction tab only)
  - Total Budget: Rs. 1,760,000
- **Number Formatting**: Auto-format inputs with commas as user types
- **Tooltips**: Added helpful tooltips explaining terms like "Plinth", "Possession", etc.
- **Reset Buttons**: Added reset functionality for both Flat and Construction tabs
- **Sync Toggle**: Auto-calculate other installments from monthly amount (on by default)
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced styling with hover effects and transitions

### 3. Modular JavaScript Architecture
- **ES6 Class Structure**: Refactored into `HousingCalculator` class with methods:
  - `initElements()` - DOM element initialization

  - `updateBudgetDisplay()` - UI updates
  - `updateBreakdownPanel()` - Breakdown panel updates
  - `syncInstallments()` - Installment synchronization
  - `reset()` - Calculator reset functionality
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `formatCurrency()` - Pakistani Rupee formatting
  - `safeParseFloat()` - Safe number parsing with validation
  - `getCurrentTab()` - Active tab detection
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling
- **No Inline Handlers**: All events bound in JavaScript

### 4. Accessibility & Internationalization
- **ARIA Labels**: Added `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` to all inputs
